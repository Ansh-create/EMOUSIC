 <p align="justify">In this project I have used the libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, EEL etc. It allows the user to capture their image
through webcam and after detecting the mood of the user, accordingly it plays the song.
• I have used haarcascade trained model provided by OpenCV for face segmentation from the captured image.
• It also has a connectivity of JavaScript with python. Like we can say as html-JS as frontend and python as backend. The reason for choosing this was the frontend of html with CSS give us too many facilities for our project.</p>
